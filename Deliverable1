8.       Persona
8.1. Administrator
            	Kevin is an employee of the department store who owns the new point-of-sale system. Before the introduction of the automated system, he had difficulties in managing the point of sales  in the department store. It’s not easy for him to  track the progress of the clerks and the auditors since he cannot be at all locations at the same time.  Through the new POS system, he will be able to monitor their works more closely by just staying into one computer terminal.
 
8.2. Auditor
            	Andrew is also an employee of the department store who owns the new point-of-sale system. Before, he has to manually examine and validate all transactions made by the clerk with the inventory of the items in the department store. Sometimes, due to huge paper works, he is unable to complete the sales report on time. Since Andrew is a computer literate person  as well as an expert in accounting, he is expecting that he can submit his report on time.
 
8.3. Clerk
            	Samantha is another employee of the department store. Before the automated point of sale system, she has to manually write all purchased items and calculate the total sales of every transaction. This may sometimes lead to mistakes. Now, she expects that she can avoid these mistakes with the help of this new point of sale system
